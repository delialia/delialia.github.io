Currently I work as an AI researcher for the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE) and I am based in the lovely city of Lund. I am involved in many different types of projects and I usually bring AI expertise to a multidisciplinary table. I work with academia, industry, policymakers and civil society. Interested in low-tech ethical AI for good.

Before I was employed by the European Commission to give technical advice to policymakers and standardisers on different aspects of AI as well as to carry out research in the area of trustworthy AI and algorithm auditing. I mainly focused on research for the enforcement of the new Digital Services Act and on the preparatory standardisation work of the AI Act.
I was part of the Joint Research Centre and <a href="https://algorithmic-transparency.ec.europa.eu/index_en"> European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency</a>. I am interested in the impact of AI systems on social well-being and fundamental rights, and continue to work on this research line on the detection of disinformation in social media. 

Previously I worked as a research scientist at <a href="https://chordify.net/">Chordify</a> looking at the intersection of recommender systems, graph theory and music information retrieval.

I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) at Queen Mary University of London, where I worked on machine learning, signal processing and graph theory methods for sound source separation and music analysis under the supervision of Prof. Mark Sandler and <a href="http://www.mcld.co.uk">Dr. Dan Stowell</a> (and previously Dr. Sebastian Ewert).

Before starting the PhD in London, I received my masters degree in Music & Technology (MSc) from the <a href="https://csm.cit.ie/">Cork School of Music</a> and was awarded with the highest-placed taught masters in Music & Technology CSM prize in 2015. My thesis on noise reduction using sound source separation was supervised by Dr. Derry FitzGerald.

Before that, I received a masters degree in Electronic Systems (MEng) with major in Nanotechnology from the <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/">Dublin City University</a> and studied electrical characterisation of defects in semiconductors materials in my thesis supervised by Prof. Patrick McNally.

My bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering was previously awarded by the <a href="https://www.insa-lyon.fr/">Institut National des Sciences Appliquees (INSA) Lyon</a>. In between finishing the masters and starting the PhD, I worked for a while as an R&D Engineer in Gentian Services, Ireland.

I'm also the founder and organiser of the <a href="https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/4193488"> Hands-on Sound Source Separation Workshop (HOSSS)</a> series aiming to bring together experts and students in the field for a day of active brainstorming and hacking.
